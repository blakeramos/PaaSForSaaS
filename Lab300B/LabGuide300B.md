![](./images/form22.png " ")

- Now you can press save, and close the 'OrderEntryForm' tab to return to the process designer.

### **STEP 3**: Finish creating your process

![](./images/13.png " ")

- From the right, click the drop down next to gateways, and drag & drop an Exclusive gateway to the right of the start action. 

![](./images/14.png " ")

- Now click the blue box to the left of start, then the pencil icon. 

![](./images/15.png " ")

- Now click the line between Exclusive gateway & User task.

![](./images/29.png " ")

Click the pencil. Then click the pencil to the right of the condition box. 

![](./images/30.png " ")

Enter this logic, you can highlight the totalPrice field, press 'Insert Into Expression' and then add ' > 12000. This will route the integration to need human approval if the total price is over $12,000. We hardcoded a value of $15,000 previously in order to ensure you will need the human approval.

- Your process is coming along well, in the next steps we will add the integration to your process and complete its development.  

### **STEP 4**: Add the integration to the process, Test the Process Application

![](./images/31.png " ")

- This is what it should look like on your mapper now

![](./images/70.png " ")

- Map the fields from your form table to the fields in the Fusion table like so.

![](./images/48.png " ")

- Your process is complete and should like this now. 

![](./images/71.png " ")

- Click publish, add a comment, then click the publish button.

![](./images/72.png " ")

- After hitting publish, press activate in the blue box, then 'Try in Test Mode' in the green box.

- Press activate, leave the checkbox as is.

![](./images/74.png " ")

- You should see this confirmation

![](./images/75.png " ")

- Press save and test.

### **STEP 5**: Test your Process:

- Click on **Create Order** in **My Apps** section.

![](./images/87.png " ")

- Select **EXW** for Incoterms, **Net 60** for Payment terms, input a PO date. Click on the blue + icon. Add **Vario tablet** as the table name, quantity is **3** and unit price **300**. Click **Submit**

![](./images/78.png " ").

- Since the condition to forward the order to the Process owner isn't satisfied the integration will be directly called. You can view Integration status from the monitoring section underneath integration as mentioned in the previous labs.

![](./images/81.png " ").

![](./images/82.png " ").

![](./images/83.png " ").

![](./images/84.png " ").

- Test the process again. Enter quantity and net price such that total is over $15,000 and submit. 

![](./images/86.png " ").

- Select **My Tasks** from the menu on the right. 

![](./images/90.png " ").

- Select your process. 

![](./images/91.png " ").

- You can view your process details. Note that when you are reviewing your process you are reviewing it as a proces owner. Once you review your process details you can approve/reject 

![](./images/92.png " ").

- Go to **Processes** on the menu.

![](./images/93.png " ").

- You can view your end process flow here to see if it was successful.

![](./images/94.png " ").

![](./images/95.png " ").

## Summary

-   In this lab, you developed an OIC process application that calls the previous integration you built. Together, this gives you an order entry form that performs as if natively part of your ERP Cloud implementation.

-   **You are finished with all of the labs!**
