## Introduction

*In addition to the workshop*, feel free to watch the walk-through companion video by clicking on the following link:
[Lab 300A Walkthrough Video](<INSERT LINK HERE>)

In this lab, you will use Oracle Integration to make a connection to your Cloud ERP instance. From there, you will build a basic application integration that creates an Order. After that, you will create a Process that allows for human approval. You will create a process form that allows you to enter order information. The process allows you to define workflow approval and call an integration to create an Order within ERP.

## Part 1. Gather Pre-requisite Information

### **STEP 1**: Obtain Oracle cloud ERP Information

-   Obtain Oracle cloud ERP connection URL. 

![](./images/ERP.png " ")

-   Usernames to Oracle cloud ERP environments are **bala.gupta** and **ava.clark**.

-   Obtain Password information used to log into your cloud environment.

### **STEP 2**: Obtain Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Information

You will need the following to be able to connect to the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse : 

-    Wallet file

-    Wallet password

-    Database user and password

-    Database service name

-    Create **table**

## Part 2. Create Connections

### **STEP 1**: Create Connection to Oracle Cloud ERP 

-   Log into Oracle Integration cloud and click on **Integrations** from the menu on the left hand side. 
![](./images/OIChome.png " ")

-   This will take you to the Integrations portion of Oracle Integration from where we can build integrations between Applications. 

-   We will first create connections to all the application we plan on connecting to in our integration. In our case a connection to Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse. 

-   Now select **Connections** from the menu on the left to take you to the connections page. Once on the **Connections** page click on the **Create button** on the top right corner. 

![](./images/ConnectionsPage.png " ")

-   In the search bar type in **ERP** and select **Oracle ERP Cloud**

![](./images/SearchForERPConnector.png " ")

- Click on the select button. 

![](./images/SelectERPConnector.png " ")

-   You will be prompted to enter a name for the connection you are trying to make. Enter **ERP Cloud** in the name section and the Identifier will auto-generate. Leave the role as **Trigger and Invoke**. Click the **Create Button**.

-   Note: When creating a connection the name cannot be the same as any existing connection. If you are in a shared instance please add your initials at the end of the name.

![](./images/ERPDetails.png " ")

-   We now have to input the credentials for our Oracle ERP Cloud connection. This consists of a connection URL and a security credential. Here the Security credentials are for the user you use to log into ERP Cloud. Please note that the capabilities of the adapter will change according to what roles and responsibility the user has been assigned. For example : If your user doesn't have privileges within the ERP system to view Order Information, you will not be able to use the corresponding APIs with the adapter. 

-   First click on the **Configure Connectivity Button** to enter connection URL. 

![](./images/ERPConnectandSecure.png " ")

### **STEP 1**: Map to CreateERPOrder

-   Click on **Map to CreateERPOrder** and click on the **pencil icon**.

![](./images/MapERP1.png " ")

-   The Mapping canvas will open up. Our goal is to map data elements from the **Source** (column on the left) to the **Target** (column on the right). Expand **request-wrapper** from **Sources** column and **request** from **Target** column.

![](./images/MapERP2.png " ")

-   Expand **Order** under **request**.

![](./images/MapERP3.png " ")

-   You can map data elements from source to targe by clicking and holding the data element and dragging it over to the data element you want to map it to. Click and hold **TransactionIdentifier** and drag it to **SourceTransactionIdentifier**. Once you are over the Target element let go of your mouse and the elements should be mapped. This is signified by a line between both elements. 

-   Also map **TransactionIdentifier** to **SourceTransactionNumber**

![](./images/MapERP4.png " ")

-   Next lets hardcode a value to a target element. Right click on **SourceTransactionSystem** and click on **Create Target Node**. 

![](./images/MapERP5.png " ")

-   A box will pop up in the bottom of the screen. Enter **"LEG1"** and click the check box on the right.

## Part 5. Monitor Integrations

### **STEP 1**: Tracking your Integration

-   Click on the hamburger icon on the top right corner and select **Tracking**. 

![](./images/Tracking1.png " ")

-   Drag **TransactionIdentifier** to the **Tracking Field**. All integrations need at least one tracking field assigned before they can be activated. This allows for you to identify your integrations in monitoring and is a useful field to keep track of within running integrations.

![](./images/Tracking2.png " ")

-   Click Save

![](./images/Tracking3.png " ")

### **STEP 2**:  Enabling your Integration

-   Click the **Switch Button** to activate your integration.

![](./images/Enable1.png " ")

-   Select the check box to **Enable Tracing**. This allows you to see integrations that have run in the **Monitoring** section. 

![](./images/Enable2.png " ")

-   Select the check box to **Include Payload**. This will allow you to see the data being sent to the integration and how it is being processed. 

![](./images/Enable3.png " ")

-   You can access your activated API by clicking the **Gear Icon** against the integration and clicking the **Endpoint URL**.

![](./images/Enable5.png " ")

### **STEP 3**: Testing and Monitoring your Integration

-   You can test your integration using a tool like Postman. Enter your API URL. Select **POST** Action from the drop down. Under the **Authorization** tab, select **Basic Auth** from the **Type** drop down. Enter the **Username & Password** for your OIC environment. 

![](./images/Postman1.png " ")

-   From the **Body** tab select **raw** type and **JSON** from the drop down for your request payload.

![](./images/Postman2.png " ")

-   Enter the following payload to test your API. Then click **Send Button**. 

```JSON
{ "TransactionIdentifier": "Creekside Warehouse-14073", "BuyingPartyName": "Pinnacle Technologies", "BuyingPartyContactName": "Isaac Nelson", "BusinessUnitName": "US1 Business Unit", "ShipToPartyIdentifier": "100000000409220", "ShipToPartyName": "Pinnacle Technologies", "BillToCustomerName": "Pinnacle Technologies", "ShipToPartySiteIdentifier": "300000048361113", "BillToAccountSiteUseIdentifier": "300000048361115", "OrderItems": [ { "ProductId": "AS46336", "Quantity": 3 }, { "ProductId": "AS46336", "Quantity": 3 } ] }
```

![](./images/Postman3.png " ")

-   Verify your response payload and that the Status is a **200 OK**.

![](./images/Postman4.png " ")

-   To view runtime details of our integration lets go to the monitoring section.

-   Click the back arrow at the top left corner. 

![](./images/Monitoring1.png " ")

-   Select **Monitoring**.

![](./images/Monitoring2.png " ")

-   Select **Tracking**.

![](./images/Monitoring3.png " ")

-   Find your integration and click on the Transaction Identifier(Our Tracking field).

![](./images/Monitoring4.png " ")

-   Notice that your integration path is all green. If there was an error it would be signified with Red at the point of failure. Click on the **hamburger icon** on the top left.

![](./images/Monitoring5.png " ")

-   Select **Activity Stream**.

![](./images/Monitoring6.png " ")

-   You can view the payload and data transformations that happen through out your integration. Select any of the **messages** for a more in-depth view. This is a very useful tool when trying to debug integrations. 

![](./images/Monitoring7.png " ")

## Summary

-   In this lab, you learned how to build an end to end integration with Oracle Cloud ERP and the Autonomous Data Warehouse using the Oracle integration platforms low-code development platform.

-   **You are ready to move on to the next lab!**
